## A simple scraper for NOAA buoy data.
I wanted to write a program that would scrape the data from the NOAA's buoys so that I could learn how to visualize some data.

Right now it is written to scrape the [Point Loma South](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=46232) buoy near all of my home breaks :-). I think it could be generalized for any buoy data though, since all of the buoys I have seen on the NOAA site have the same format.

Planned features:
* Web interface.
* Historic data view.
* Quick stats 'dashboard' (water temp, largest swell, etc.).
* Cool data viz stuff.
* Nice fonts and design throughout.
